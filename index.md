### Statement			

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in mathematics, with a keen interest in algebraic topology and geometric topoloogy.For my upcoming graduate career, I am privileged to have the guidance of Professor Pan Huiping. Under his mentorship this semester, I am immersed in studying the thoery of Quadratic Differentials and Teichmüller Spaces, areas of research that deeply explore the topology and geometry ofRiemann Surfaces. During this semester, I am also presenting a report on the Quadratic Differentials by Stebel in Prof. Huiping Pan's reading.

### htp-invarance of (Singular) homology

**Main thm** If $f,g:X\to Y$ is homotopic, then $f,g$ induces the same homology homomorphism $H_{*}(X)\to H_{*}(Y)$.

**pf** The key step is so straightforward.You wish to construct a new brick with boundary $\sigma_1-\sigma_2$,where $\sigma_1,\sigma_2$ are standard $n-$simplexes for distinct $n\in \mathbb Z_{+}$.$n=0,1,2$ is so easy. The case for bigger $n$ can be guessed and tested.

We name the opeation prism(cylinder) operation $P:C_n\to C_{n+1}$. Given $n$-simplex $\sigma$ , $P(\sigma)$ is like the cylinder with upper and bottom face $\sigma$. Thus you must guess what the expression of the operation looks like! (有一种方法叫递推法，可以利用低维的推出高维的，不过直觉上还有点执果索因的味道，不如构造法直观，下面用构造法)

What you need to do is to design any method of subdividing $\Delta^{n}\times I$ into $n+1$ $n-$simplexes geomoetrically.(我曾经从组合结构上想代数表达式，无功而返，难度较高，可行但远不如几何上想一个细分方法简洁直观)。Now similar to exhaustion,we give the subdicision by a "exhaustion"  function.
